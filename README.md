Pjax on Google App Engine
=========================
This is just a demo of a server setup of Pjax on Google App Engine (or Webapp2 to be precise).

And yes, it works pretty well!

The templating engine used here is Jinja2. The use of other templating engines won't really affect the usage of pjax on Google App Engine.

Definitely check [base_handler.py](https://github.com/maverick97/gae-pjax/blob/master/src/base_handler.py) out. In `class BaseHandler`, I have defined `pjax` function that handles the background magic.
